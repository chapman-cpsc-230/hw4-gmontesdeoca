## Description

Complete exercises out of the book and create a program to determine the length of an integer. Create a program that makes a histogram, then create a second program that enhances the first.

## What I Learned from This

I learned how to use nested loops to determine whether a function can be evaluated at certain values.


## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:
